== Description ==

When using WordPress multisite, the "My Sites" menu item will be added to the admin bar. Out of the box, this menu has a few limitations:
1. It is as wide as the longest title of one of your sites. Lame.
2. If your list of sites is too long, it will not fit on your screen and you can't reach the bottom ones. Also lame.
This plugin is an attempt to remedy these and other issues and make the My Sites menu as useful as possible for multiple-site admins.

What it does:
1. Site titles are truncated if they get too long so your menu isn't crazy wide.
2. Adds an accelerated hover scrolling effect so that you can always reach every site on the list.

All in all, this is a very light plugin. It works by removing the existing My Sites menu and replacing it with a new menu with truncated site names (for those that are too long). The javascript accelerated hover scrolling effect scrolls the My Sites list slower when your browser window is longer, and faster when your browser window is shorter so that you can always access all your sites, regardless of the length of the list, or the size of your browser window.


== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `better-my-sites-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Network Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Thats it!
